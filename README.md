Hello Visitor,

I'm Marco, a chemical engineer by training currently working in the pharmaceutical industry.
In 2022, my goal is to transition to a software engineering role making equal or more than my current salary.
I plan to use GitHub to develop good code management practices and also be able to access my code across various platforms in my home.

And towards the middle of the year, I hope to have a couple cool projects on here as well, instead of only LeetCode practice.

Stay tuned and thanks for checking me out.
